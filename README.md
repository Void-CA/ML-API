# AI Model Prediction App

## Description

This repository contains a simple web application for making predictions using an artificial intelligence model. The app is built with Flask and utilizes a machine learning model to classify data and return results based on the provided features.

### Features

- **User Interface**: An interactive web page that allows users to input data for prediction.
- **Prediction**: The AI model makes predictions based on the input data and displays the predicted class along with a representative image.
- **Deployment**: Includes basic Flask setup to serve the application and handle prediction requests.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A microframework for Python to develop web applications.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle backend requests and update the user interface with prediction results.
